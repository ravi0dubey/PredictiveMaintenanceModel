# PredictiveMaintenanceModel
# Step 1: load dataset into dataframe
# Step 2: Cleansing of data
# Step 3: Create a profile report
# Step 4: Save the report in html format in the folder where project resides
# Step 5: Extracting X and Y(Target Column values from  dataset
# Step 6: Creating a class of LinearRegression
# Step 7 :Creating the model by placing dataset
# Step 8: Calculating the co-efficient value
# Step 9 Saving the model for future reference
# Step 10 : We can read the model created by us
# Step11: Loading new dataset to test the accuracy of the saved_linear_model
# Step 12:cleansing of dataset_accuracy_test
# Step 13 : Extracing X_NEW and Y_NEW
# Step 14: getting the accuracy of the linear model This is R2 statistics
